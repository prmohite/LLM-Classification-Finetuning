# 🤖 LLM-Classification-Finetuning
🎯 The goal of this project is to predict human preferences between responses from two large language models (LLMs).  
🗂️ The dataset comes from the ChatBot Arena, where judges are given a prompt and responses from two different models.  
✅ They then select the better response — or mark it as a tie.
